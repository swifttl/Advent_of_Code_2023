> *Reflections* - May be the cleanest planning and execution yet!

> > >Instead of constantly calling back three different arrays, I used a dict. to only call back a specific array as needed!
> > >Successfully used split() which made life  so much easier.
> > >Continued practicing append() and learned clear() and min/max().
